## General Information
- Project is executed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA, Python and python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to derive insights from the given dataset
- Lending Club wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default as approving loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).   Identification of these risky loan applicants is crucial to the business to limit the amount of credit loss.
- The aim is to identify patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the given ‘Loan Dataset’ which indicates if a person is likely to default, which may be used for
  taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- Dataset used for the Lending Club Case Study is the loan dataset with 39717 rows and 111 columns.

## Conclusions
- Loan defaults are high for loans with 60 months term hence focus on shorter term loans would be advisable for risky applications.
- Lending Club should restructure interest rates as the defaults increase for higher interest rates.
- Loan defaults are the highest amongst small businesses. Lending club should reduce either the loan amount or the term for such business
- Defaults tend to increase for higher loan amounts, hence Lending Club should focus on providing smaller amounts to reduce risk of defaults.
- Lending should also focus on offering loans to customers with higher annual income as defaults are less
